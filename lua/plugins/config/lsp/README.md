### LSP Setup

This file contains LSP setup hooks for particular languages. It is intended to be lazily-loaded by the `config` functions
of languages (see `lua.plugins.lang`).

LSPs are automatically installed by Mason if they are not already present. One can inspect or manually install plugins via Mason
if desired.
