### Plugin Config

This directory contains files which contain plugin configuration. A dedicated file for plugin configuration
is preferred over specifying the config directly in the plugin specification when the configuration
is large. With that in mind, most of the time we only specify a handful of configuration keys for a plugin though, so the configuration will be included there instead.
